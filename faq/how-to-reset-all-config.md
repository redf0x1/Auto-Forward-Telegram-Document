# How to Reset All Config

{% hint style="info" %}
So easy. You use the /profile command and you will see the 🔐 **Reset Config** option.&#x20;

Once you have clicked 🔐 **Reset Config**, all configurations (tasks, whitelists, blacklists, replace...etc) will be restored back to the original defaults as when you just first connect.
