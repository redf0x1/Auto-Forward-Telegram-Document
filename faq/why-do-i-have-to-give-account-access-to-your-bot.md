# Why do I have to give account access to your bot?

{% hint style="info" %}
There are many reasons why our bot needs account access and to cover them all here would be a long read so instead we will show you an example of features between a bot which can be used without account connection and our bot.
{% endhint %}

| Features                           |         Without Login         | Our BOT |
| ---------------------------------- | :---------------------------: | :-----: |
| Forward from public channels       |              YES              |   YES   |
| Forward Private Channel            |               NO              |   YES   |
| Forward channel without bot join   |               NO              |   YES   |
| Forward User/Bot                   |               NO              |   YES   |
| Forward in Rewrite Mode            |    NO (its a bot after all)   |   YES   |
| Read/Send message to every channel |    NO (its a bot after all)   |   YES   |
| One-Many, Many-One Redirections    |               NO              |   YES   |
| Filtering                          | Probably (depends on the bot) |   YES   |
| Whitelist/Blacklist                | Probably (depends on the bot) |   YES   |
| Text Manipulation                  | Probably (depends on the bot) |   YES   |
| Translate language                 |               NO              |   YES   |
| Clone Source                       |               NO              |   YES   |

If you just need a bot to forward messages without **Rewrite Mode** and you have access to the channels you want to Forward From and To (you need to be a admin there) than you can use a bot without account access if that worries you. Our bot has many more advance features than any other bot but we do understand that users have their own privacy concerns.

Then this bot will not be able to help you out. All the features of this bot require you to be logged in to the bot.
