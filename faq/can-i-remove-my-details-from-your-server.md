# Can I remove my details from your server?

{% hint style="info" %}
So easy. You use the /profile command and you will see the ðŸš¬ **Logout** option.&#x20;

Once you have clicked ðŸš¬ **Logout**, all information, data, running tasks will be stopped and removed cleanly from our database and cannot be recovered.
